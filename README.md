# 📱 Lost and Found App

### 🏫 Project by Team Infinite Loopers

## 🧠 Overview

In our college campus, students often lose their valuable belongings such as watches, smartphones, earbuds, and other personal items.  
The **Lost and Found App** is designed to solve this real-life problem by creating a digital platform where students can **report and find lost items easily**.

Users who find an item can upload its **details, image, and location**, and the app stores it in the **Found Items List**.  
This makes it simple for owners to identify and reclaim their lost property quickly.
